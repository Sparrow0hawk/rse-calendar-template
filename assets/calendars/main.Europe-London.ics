SUMMARY:18th HiRSE Seminar - Neil Chue Hong: Can Software Metrics Improve 
 Software Quality?
UID:42828e50-7c46-406b-a02d-6bb03c00029f@4282.org
DESCRIPTION:Software quality in computational science and engineering can 
 be interpreted in two ways: does the software implement the algorithm or 
 simulate the phenomenon as expected\, and does it perform as expected i.e.
  does it scale\, is it maintainable\, is it secure?\n\nSoftware metrics 
 are the degree to which a software system possesses some relevant 
 property. Many software metrics are defined as quantitative measurements 
 based on the analysis of source code. Others\, such as those being 
 developed by the CHAOSS initiative\, focus on measuring the ability of a 
 project to deliver software that meets various criteria\, such as 
 community health or development efficiency.\n\nA key question is how 
 useful software metrics are in improving software quality when applied to 
 development in computational science and engineering\, which can differ 
 from software engineering in other areas because of evolving or unclear 
 requirements\, deployment to large-scale systems and architectures\, and 
 focus on performance.\n\nI will consider which types of software metric 
 might benefit researcher-developers and research software engineers 
 working in computational science and engineering. Can useful metrics be 
 identified by considering the differences in the way that software is 
 developed these fields?
LOCATION:The talk will be held online. The connection details will be 
 posted on a variety on channels shortly before the event (see 
 <https://www.helmholtz-hirse.de/series/2023_06_27-seminar_18.html> for a

DESCRIPTION:The Alan Turing Institute\, Edinburgh\, Newcastle\, Cambridge 
 and UCL Universities are organising a series of workshops to discuss 
 Educating Engineers for Safe AI.\n\nWe are seeking participants in this 
 workshop series who are:\n\n- AI Engineers\, Data Scientists\, Systems 
 Engineers\, ML-Ops\, Research Software Engineers\, Site Reliability 
 Engineers and more\, working in the implementation of AI systems OR\n- 
 Academics and other experts working in areas related to Safe\, Ethical\, 
 Reliable and Trustworthy Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence 
 OR\n- Academics and other experts working in professional education\, 
 CPD\, and related areas\, interested in developing materials related to 
 safe AI for professional audiences.\nThe workshops consist of two regional
  nonresidential satellite workshops in Cambridge (4th July) and in 
 Edinburgh (29th June)\, and a final residential workshop in Newcastle on 
 the 15th and 16th August.\n\nThe purpose of the workshop series is to 
 develop a roadmap toward the creation of a syllabus and set of 
 professional education materials\, targeted at software and systems 
 engineers\, so that they can be empowered to champion the creation of 
 safe\, ethical and trustworthy AI in their workplaces. Developers and 
 engineers\, appropriately empowered and skilled\, are uniquely placed to 
 ensure that the systems they build are done so according to emerging 
 ethical best practice. These materials will become part of The Turing Way 
 project.

UID:6f13951a-cbc8-40e6-a96b-4c808ed6cb39@6f13.org
DESCRIPTION:How to install high-performant software on a High Performance 
 Cluster?\n\nSoftware installation on a High Performance Cluster (HPC) is 
 different from the usual software installation on a desktop \ncomputer.In 
 order to get the best performance out of the very expensive hardware\, it 
 is best to compile software from source\, \nrather than using pre-compiled
  binaries. This sounds often easier than it actually is. One good example 
 is Basic Linear Algebra \nSubprograms (BLAS) [1]: A generic installation 
 will only deliver a very low performance. Optimising the compile process 
 will \ndeliver more performance. However\, with the sheer amount of 
 different CPUs around\, testing it for each new build with a new 
 \ncompiler is time consuming.\n\nThe solution here is to fall back what 
 others have done\, improve on it if possible and contribute back to the 
 community.\n\nOne such an example is EasyBuild [2]: software which is 
 installing high-performant scientific software on HPC clusters 
 \nautomatically.\n\nThe talk will take you through an often a bit 
 personally journey of scientific software installation\, without too much 
 of technical \njargon. It is aimed for scientists who are installing 
 software\, or write their own code. Equally\, researchers who are more 
 \nexperienced in software installation might learn something new as well.

SUMMARY:Cambridge RSE Seminar - Code Execution during peer review with 
 CODECHECK - Daniel Nust
UID:a2ac835f-b8ec-4f77-9ada-b0c8fc1917bc@a2ac.org
DESCRIPTION:Data and software are the foundation for a vast variety and 
 volume of computational\nresearch in all scientific disciplines. This is 
 how we make sense of small and huge\ndatasets using everything from one-
 off scripts to high-performance computing\ninfrastructures. Nowadays\, 
 most of these works are eventually presented to a\nscientific community in
  form of a paper for the recognition of research outputs and\ncareer 
 advancement. Research papers are increasingly accompanied by data 
 and\nsoftware to ensure transparency\, reproducibility\, and reusability. 
 This change\nis driven by shifting community practice as well as by 
 publisher guidelines.\nHowever\, the actual inspection of these building 
 blocks is not a common part\nof the publication and peer review process. 
 The CODECHECK initiative tries to make\ncode execution standard practice 
 in peer review using a particular focus and a set\nof principles. We 
 present variants of CODECHECK and highlight the possibilities\nfor 
 research software engineers to participate in academic peer review as 
 codecheckers.\nFurthermore\, we demonstrate the AGILE conference’s 
 Reproducibility Review as a\nconcrete implementation of CODECHECK . The 
 Reproducible AGILE initiative\ndemonstrates how good scientific and 
 development practices can be encouraged\nand spread through communication 
 and collaboration.\n\nDaniel is a research software engineer and postdoc 
 at the Chair of Geoinformatics\,\nTU Dresden\, Germany. He develops tools 
 for open and reproducible geoscientific\nresearch and is a proponent for 
 open scholarship and reproducibility in the projects\nNFDI4 Earth 
 (<https://nfdi4earth.de/>)\, OPTIMETA 
 (<https://projects.tib.eu/optimeta>)\, and CODECHECK

 Fellowship: ‘Sustainability and EDI (Equality\, Diversity and\nInclusion) 
 in the R Project’\, that are designed to encourage and train a new\, 
 more\ndiverse\, generation of contributors.\n\nThe initiatives vary from 
 regular support on the R Contributor Slack and in R\nContributor Office 
 Hours\, to one-off events aimed at new contributors such as 
 a\nCollaboration Campfire series and a Bug BBQ . I will report back on the
  recent R\nProject Sprint 2023\, hosted at Warwick University\, which 
 brought members of the R\nCore Team together with both novice and 
 experienced contributors to work in\ncollaboration – the first event of 
 this kind in the R community. I will discuss how\nwe hope to keep the 
 momentum going and how RSEs might contribute to the R Project\nand other 
 fundamental open source projects.

 research software\, as well as building\ncapacity through teaching\, 
 fellowships\, and other community efforts.\n\nWe are passionate about 
 making software sustainable (as in durable) so that it can\nbe used by as 
 many researchers as possible. To facilitate this we created the\nResearch 
 Software Directory (<https://research-software-directory.org/>)\, a 
 service\nto show the impact of research software.\n\nA re-occurring theme 
 in our projects is that of sustainability (as in climate change).\nOver 
 the years we have contributed to a number of projects and software related
  to\nsustainability\, including ESM Valtool (<https://esmvaltool.org/>)\, 
 software supporting\nthe evaluation of Earth system models\, and used in

 parameterisation code? - Mike Whitall
UID:35141f3e-7322-443c-af29-565b7b96a763@3514.org
DESCRIPTION:Convection parameterisations are a crucial element of global 
 atmospheric models.\nThey simulate the vertical transport of heat\, 
 moisture and momentum by convective\nclouds\, and associated rainfall. The
  majority of Tropical rainfall is associated\nwith these clouds\, which 
 are too small-scale to explicitly resolve on the model’s\ngrid and so need
  to be parameterised.\n\nMost global atmosphere models use a so-called 
 'mass-flux' form of convection\nparameterisation\, which consists of a 
 diagnostic vertical integral to compute the\nproperties of the clouds and 
 the amount of heat / moisture entrained / detrained\nat each height. The 
 calculations in a given vertical column of model grid-points\nare 
 completely independent of those in other neighbouring columns\, so it 
 would be\nsimplest to write the code so that it only considers a single 
 column at a time.\nHowever\, since we are performing a vertical integral 
 the calculations at a given\nheight within each column depend on the 
 results from those calculations at the\nlevel below\, so the scheme must 
 be structured in a vertically sequential manner\nconsidering a single 
 height-level at a time.\n\nConsidering only a single column and a single 
 height-level at a time amounts to\ncomputing only a single grid-point at a
  time. On CPU architectures\, this is\nextremely inefficient\; far greater
  computation speeds are obtained by doing many\nidentical calculations 
 simultaneously\, via vectorisation. Another challenge/opportunity\nis the 
 sparsity of the required calculations\, since convective clouds only 
 occupy a\nsmall fraction of the atmosphere’s volume.\n\nIn this talk I 
 discuss routes to exploiting both vectorisation and shared 
 memory\nparallelisation\, and how to make efficient use of memory given 
 the sparsity\, in the\ncomorph convection parameterisation fortran code 
 currently under development at the\nMet Office.\n\nHowever\, current and 
 future changes in software and HPC architectures (such as GPUs)\nmay 
 radically change the optimal code structure. Is there any way to adapt 
 our\nconvection code to these changes without completely rewriting it\, or
  write it in a\n'future proof' way?
